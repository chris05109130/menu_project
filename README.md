Robinson Menu Project

Description:

This project I decided to make a fake menu for a diner. This way around the time where I wanted to make some javascript projects to start showing what I know when it comes to 
javascript. So I decided to go with this project because it deals with some higher order array methods. All you have to is go down the menu and see the options. If you want to 
just see say the breakfast items, then go ahead and click on the brekfast section at the top and only the breakfast items will be shown. Same with the other options as well. 

I would like to expand this project into a bigger project, meaning I would like to make it to the point where you can click on an item to say add to a cart and then once you are done selecting your options you will then be taken to a end page with everything you selected followed by certain information
